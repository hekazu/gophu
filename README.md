# Gophu

## What
A learning project based on some of what was learned going through the Sockets
and Pipes book, ditching the HTTP protocol in favour of Gopher.

The executable itself is a command line tool for Gopher browsing. No
interactivity has been planned as of now.

## Why
To test the limit of my abilities (and learn to Nix Haskell properly)
